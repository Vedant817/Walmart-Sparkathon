# Flowstate

Flowstate is a centralized, AI-powered platform that provides a single source of truth for all stakeholders in the supply chain.

## Key Features:

### Predictive Inventory Management
We use AI to forecast demand based on seasonal data, online trends, and market basket analysis. This allows for automated, efficient stock ordering, minimizes deadstock, and implements dynamic pricing.

### Resilient Supply Chain Orchestration
Our platform visualizes the entire supply chain, identifies potential disruptions in real-time (like weather or traffic), and uses AI agents to automatically reroute shipments and manage inter-store stock sharing, ensuring resilience.

### Last-Mile & In-Store Optimization
We use an AI-powered fleet orchestration system to optimize delivery routes and vehicle assignments dynamically. For customers in-store, we provide a virtual 2D store layout for easy product discovery, with product placement informed by market basket analysis.

### Unified Stakeholder Dashboards
We provide dedicated, real-time dashboards for Operations Managers, Suppliers, Store Owners, and Customers, ensuring seamless data flow and collaboration.
